<heading id="h0001"><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to certain tetrazole derivatives, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which exhibit useful pharmacological properties, for example as agonists for the nicotinic acid receptor, RUP25. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more compounds of the invention, and methods of using the compounds and compositions of the invention in the treatment of metabolic-related disorders, including dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, Syndrome-X and the like. The present invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the invention in combination with other active agents such as those belonging to the class of Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, aldose reductase inhibitors, biguanides, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, squalene synthesis inhibitors, fibrates, LDL catabolism enhancers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, insulin secretion enhancers, thiazolidinedione and the like.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b></heading>
<heading id="h0003"><b>Compounds of the invention as Antilipolytic Agents</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Atherosclerosis and stroke are the numbers one and number three leading causes of death of both men and women in the United States. Type 2 diabetes is a public health problem that is serious, widespread and increasing. Elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are, independently, risk factors for atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular pathologies. In addition, high levels of plasma free fatty acids are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. One strategy for decreasing LDL-cholesterol, increasing HDL-cholesterol, and decreasing plasma free fatty acids is to inhibit lipolysis in adipose tissue. This approach involves regulation of hormone sensitive lipase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in lipolysis. Lipolytic agents increase cellular levels of cAMP, which leads to activation of hormone sensitive lipase within adipocytes. Agents that lower intracellular cAMP levels, by contrast, would be antilipolytic.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">It is also worth noting in passing that an increase in cellular levels of cAMP down-regulates the secretion of adiponectin from adipocytes [Delporte, ML et al. <i>Biochem J</i>(2002) July]. Reduced levels of plasma adiponectin have been associated with metabolic-related disorders, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [Matsuda, M et al. J Biol Chem (2002) July and reviewed therein].<!-- EPO <DP n="2"> --></p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Nicotinic acid (niacin, pyridine-3-carboxylic acid) is a water-soluble vitamin required by the human body for health, growth and reproduction; a part of the Vitamin B complex. Nicotinic acid is also one of the oldest used drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It is a valuable drug in that it favorably affects virtually all of the lipid parameters listed above [Goodman and Gilman's Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, editors Harmon JG and Limbird LE, Chapter 36, Mahley RW and Bersot TP (2001) pages 971-1002]. The benefits of nicotinic acid in the treatment or prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have been documented in six major clinical trials [Guyton JR (1998) Am J Cardiol 82:18U-23U]. Nicotinic acid and related derivatives, such as, acipimox have recently been discussed [Lorenzen, A et al (2001) Molecular Pharmacology 59:349-357]. Structure and synthesis of additional analogs or derivatives of nicotinic acid are discussed throughout the Merck Index, An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs, and Biologicals, Tenth Edition (1983), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Nicotinic acid inhibits the production and release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, likely via an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels, and a concomitant decrease in hormone sensitive lipase activity. Agonists that down-regulate hormone sensitive lipase activity leading to a decrease in plasma free fatty acid levels are likely to have therapeutic value. The consequence of decreasing plasma free fatty acids is two-fold. First, it will ultimately lower LDL-cholesterol and raise HDL-cholesterol levels, independent risk factors, thereby reducing the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular incidence subsequent to atheroma formation. Second, it will provide an increase in insulin sensitivity in individuals with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, the use of nicotinic acid as a therapeutic is partially limited by a number of associated, adverse side-effects. These include flushing, free fatty acid rebound, and liver toxicity.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">The rational development of novel, nicotinic acid receptor agonists that have fewer side-effects will be valuable, but to date this has been hindered by the inability to molecularly identify the nicotinic acid receptor. Furthermore, other receptors of the same class may exist on the surface of adipocytes and similarly decrease hormone sensitive lipase activity through a reduction in the level of intracellular cAMP but without the elicitation of adverse effects such as flushing, thereby representing promising novel therapeutic targets. Recent work suggests that nicotinic acid probably acts through a specific GPCR [Lorenzen A, et al. (2001) Molecular Pharmacology 59:349-357 and reviewed therein]. Further work has suggested that the effects of nicotinic acid on macrophages, spleen and probably adipocytes are mediated via this specific G PCR [Lorenzen A, et al. (2002) Biochemical Pharmacology 64:645-648 and reviewed therein].</p>

<p id="p0122" num="0122">A compound of the structure <b>(BF)</b> can be prepared from the keto ester <b>(AM)</b> by reacting with hydrazine hydrate in a polar solvent such as ethanol containing glacial acetic acid to give the pyrazole <b>(AW).</b> The pyrazole <b>(AW)</b> can be reacted with a sufonyl chloride such as p-toluene sulfonyl chloride in a solvent such as CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> in the presence of a base such as pyridine to give the <i>N</i>-sulfonylated derivative <b>(AX).</b> The pyrazole ester <b>(AX)</b> can be deprotected under acidic conditions using an acid such as TFA in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> to form <b>(AY).</b> The pyrazole acid <b>(AY)</b> can be converted to the nitrile <b>(BB)</b> using a similar sequence of steps described for <b>(AG').</b> The ketone <b>(BB)</b> can be converted to the vinyl triflate <b>(BC)</b> using Commins' reagent in the presence of a base such as LDA in a solvent such as THF.</p>
<p id="p0123" num="0123">The triflate <b>(BC)</b> can be coupled with tetramethyltin in the presence of a base such as lithium chloride and a catalyst such as tetrakis triphenyl phosphine palladium (0) in a suitable solvent such as THF or toluene. The p-toluene sulfonyl group can be removed by reacting with tetra butyl ammonium fluoride solution in a solvent such as THF to give the pyrazole <b>(BE).</b> The final compound is prepared by reacting the nitrile <b>(BE)</b> with an azide such as sodium azide, in the presence of a Lewis acid such as zinc bromide, to give the tetrazole <b>(BF).</b></p>

<p id="p0125" num="0125">Compounds of Formula <b>(I)</b> may have one or more chiral centers, and therefore exist as enantiomers or diastereomers. The invention is understood to extend to all such enantiomers, diastereomers and mixtures thereof, including racemates. Formula <b>(I)</b> and the formulae described herein, <i>supra,</i> are intended to represent all individual isomers and mixtures thereof, unless stated or shown otherwise.</p>
<p id="p0126" num="0126">Racemic mixtures can be resolved into the optical pure enatiomers by known methods, for example, by separation of diastereomeric salts thereof with an optically active acid, and liberating the optically active amine compound by treatment with a base. Another method for resolving racemates into the optical pure enatiomers is based upon chromatography on an optically active matrix or chiral support. Certain racemic compounds of the present invention can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of d- or 1-(tartrates, mandelates, or camphorsulphonate) salts for example. The compounds of the present invention may also be resolved by the formation of diastereomeric amides or ester by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with an optically active activated carboxylic acid such as that derived from (+) or(-) phenylalanine, (+) or (-) phenylglycine, (+) or (-) camphanic acid or by the formation ofdiastereomeric carbamates by reaction of the compounds of the present invention with an optically active chloroformate or the like subsequently hydrolyzed.</p>

<heading id="h0011"><b>Compositions of the Present Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0147" num="0147">Some embodiments of the present invention include pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound according to Formula <b>(I)</b> in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<p id="p0148" num="0148">Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<p id="p0149" num="0149">Formulations can be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly mixing the active compound(s) with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or both, in the required proportions, and then, if necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p0150" num="0150">Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents, tabletting lubricants, and disintegrants can be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration can be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions, and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations can be in the form of dry powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including edible oils), preservatives, and flavorings and colorants can be added to the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms can be prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a<!-- EPO <DP n="35"> --> suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and scaling an appropriate vial or ampoule. These are just Ã  few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms.</p>
<p id="p0151" num="0151">A compound of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques well known to those in the art. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, outside those mentioned herein, are known in the art; for example, see Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20<sup>th</sup> Edition, 2000, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, (Editors: Gennaro, A. R., et al.).</p>
<p id="p0152" num="0152">While it is possible that a compound for use in treatment may, in an alternative use, be administered as a raw or pure chemical, it is preferable however to present the compound or "active ingredient" as a pharmaceutical formulation or composition further comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Therefore, one aspect of the present invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in combination with at least one compound according to Formula <b>(I)</b>.</p>
<p id="p0153" num="0153">The invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefor. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not overly deleterious to the recipient thereof.</p>
<p id="p0154" num="0154">Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, sub-cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation, insufflation or by a transdermal patch. Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with a minimum of degradation of the drug. Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdermal patch based upon the needs of the artisan.</p>
<p id="p0155" num="0155">The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages thereof, and in such form can be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may<!-- EPO <DP n="36"> --> contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.</p>
<p id="p0156" num="0156">For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are capsules, tablets, powders, granules or a suspension, with conventional additives such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose; and with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water can be used as a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p>
<p id="p0157" num="0157">Compounds of the present invention or a solvate or physiologically functional derivative thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions, specifically as RUP25 receptor agonists. By the term "active ingredient" is defined in the context of a "pharmaceutical composition" and shall mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary pharmacological effect, as opposed to an "inactive ingredient" which would generally be recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit.</p>
<p id="p0158" num="0158">The dose when using the compounds of the present invention can vary within wide limits, and as is customary and is known to the physician, it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated, on the condition of the patient, on the compound employed or on whether an acute or chronic disease state is treated is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention. Representative doses of the present invention include, but not limited to, about 0.001 mg to about 5000 mg, about 0.001 to about 2500 mg, about 0.001 to about 1000 mg, 0.001 to about 500 mg, 0.001 mg to about 250 mg, about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg, and about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg. Multiple doses can be administered during the day, especially when relatively large amounts are deemed to be needed, for example 2, 3 or 4, doses. Depending on the individual and as deemed appropriate from the patient's physician or care-giver it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the doses described herein.</p>
<p id="p0159" num="0159">The amount of active ingredient, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. In general, one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate <i>in vivo</i> data obtained in a model system to another, for example, an animal model to a human. Typically, animal models include, but are not<!-- EPO <DP n="37"> --> limited to, the rodents diabetes models as described in Example 1, <i>infra;</i> the mouse atherosclerosis model as described in Example 2, <i>infra;</i> or the <i>in vivo</i> animal athosclerosis model as described in Example 5, <i>infra.</i> In some circumstances, these extrapolations may merely be based on the weight of the animal model in comparison to another, such as a mammal, preferably a human, however, more often, these extrapolations are not simply based on weight differences, but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilized, on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the Formula <b>(I)</b> and as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety factors, such as, those cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize that dosage and dosage regimen outside these typical ranges can be tested and, where appropriate, can be used in the methods of this invention.</p>
<p id="p0160" num="0160">The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself can be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4, part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it can be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose indicated.</p>
<p id="p0161" num="0161">The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the invention.</p>
<p id="p0162" num="0162">For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.</p>
<p id="p0163" num="0163">In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.<!-- EPO <DP n="38"> --></p>
<p id="p0164" num="0164">In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desire shape and size.</p>
<p id="p0165" num="0165">The powders and tablets may contain varying percentage amounts of the active compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may contain from 0.5 to about 90 percent of the active compound; however, an artisan would know when amounts outside of this range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.</p>
<p id="p0166" num="0166">For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.</p>
<p id="p0167" num="0167">Formulations suitable for vaginal administration can be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.</p>
<p id="p0168" num="0168">Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.</p>
<p id="p0169" num="0169">The compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and can be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory<!-- EPO <DP n="39"> --> agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.</p>
<p id="p0170" num="0170">Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilizing and thickening agents, as desired.</p>
<p id="p0171" num="0171">Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well known suspending agents.</p>
<p id="p0172" num="0172">Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.</p>
<p id="p0173" num="0173">For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention can be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch.</p>
<p id="p0174" num="0174">Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions can be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents.</p>
<p id="p0175" num="0175">Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.</p>
<p id="p0176" num="0176">Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations can be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this can be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this can be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.</p>
<p id="p0177" num="0177">Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant. If the compounds of the Formula <b>(I)</b> or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols, for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be carried out, for example, using a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds of the Formula <b>(I)</b> as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well-known to the<!-- EPO <DP n="40"> --> person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example, solutions or dispersions of the compounds of the Formula <b>(I)</b> in water, water/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be employed using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability, solubilizers, dispersants and others, and, if appropriate, customary propellants, for example include carbon dioxide, CFC's, such as, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane; and the like. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug can be controlled by provision of a metered valve.</p>
<p id="p0178" num="0178">In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 10 microns or less. Such a particle size can be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient can be employed.</p>
<p id="p0179" num="0179">Alternatively the active ingredients can be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example, a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition can be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder can be administered by means of an inhaler.</p>
<p id="p0180" num="0180">The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.</p>
<p id="p0181" num="0181">Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration are preferred compositions.</p>
<p id="p0182" num="0182">Compounds of the present invention can be converted to "pro-drugs." The term "pro-drugs" refers to compounds that have been modified with specific chemical groups known in the art and when administered into an individual these groups undergo biotransformation to give the parent compound. Pro-drugs can thus be viewed as compounds of the invention containing one or more specialized non-toxic protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate a property of the compound. In general, the "pro-drug" approach is utilized to facilitate oral absorption. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B.
