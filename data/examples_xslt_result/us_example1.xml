         <com:P com:id="p-0034" com:pNumber="0033">Apparatus Configuration</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0035" com:pNumber="0034">First, a configuration of an action recognition apparatus in the present example embodiment will be described with reference to <com:FigureReference com:idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</com:FigureReference>. <com:FigureReference com:idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</com:FigureReference> is a diagram showing an example of an action recognition apparatus in a case where learning is to be performed.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0036" com:pNumber="0035">As shown in <com:FigureReference com:idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</com:FigureReference>, an action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> is an apparatus that accurately recognize actions of a target object. The action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> includes a generation unit <com:B>2</com:B>, an action recognition and estimation unit <com:B>3</com:B>, an action recognition loss calculation unit <com:B>4</com:B>, an estimation loss calculation unit <com:B>5</com:B>, and a learning parameter updating unit <com:B>6</com:B>.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0037" com:pNumber="0036">Among these units, the generation unit <com:B>2</com:B> generates an addition image by adding a preset setting image to a target object image corresponding to a target object. A target object is an object that is a target of action recognition, such as a human body, a human body part, a non-human creature, a machine, or the like. A target object image is an image corresponding to a target object in an image (e.g. an image in a video) captured by an image capturing apparatus. A setting image is an image that is set in learning, for example, in order to make it difficult to recognize a target object image from an image in which the target object is captured. In addition, a setting image is an image corresponding to a still life, a building, or the like, in addition to the above-described target object. An addition image is an image only including a target object image or an image including a target object image and setting images. An addition image is an image formed by placing setting images on the front side, the back side, or both front and back sides of the target object image.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0038" com:pNumber="0037">Next, the action recognition and estimation unit <com:B>3</com:B> performs action recognition regarding the target object by using the addition image, outputs action recognition information indicating the result of action recognition, estimates the setting image by using the addition image, and outputs estimation information indicating the result of estimation.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0039" com:pNumber="0038">Next, the action recognition loss calculation unit <com:B>4</com:B> calculates an action recognition loss by using reference action recognition information generated in advance based on the addition image, and the action recognition information. The estimation loss calculation unit <com:B>5</com:B> also calculates an estimation loss by using reference estimation information generated in advance based on the addition image, and the estimation information. The learning parameter updating unit <com:B>6</com:B> updates learning parameters by using the action recognition loss and the estimation loss.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0040" com:pNumber="0039">As described above, in the present example embodiment, various target object images and setting images are prepared, a large number of addition images in different patterns are generated, and the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> can be trained using a large number of addition images. Therefore, it is possible to improve accuracy in action recognition performed by the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B>. That is to say, the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> is trained using a large number of addition images generated by utilizing a computer or the like, instead of using actually captured images as in conventional art, and therefore it is possible to improve accuracy in action recognition performed by the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B>.

         <com:P com:id="p-0090" com:pNumber="0089">In step A<com:B>5</com:B>, the learning parameter updating unit <com:B>7</com:B> acquires the action recognition loss output from the action recognition loss calculation unit <com:B>4</com:B> and the estimation loss output from the estimation loss calculation unit <com:B>5</com:B>, derives updating parameters using, for example, the backpropagation method used in machine learning, and updates the updating parameters in the holding unit <com:B>7</com:B>.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0091" com:pNumber="0090">In step A<com:B>6</com:B>, the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> determines whether or not to terminate learning. For example, when the processing indicated by steps A<com:B>1</com:B> to A<com:B>5</com:B> has been performed on all of the target object images or predetermined target object images stored in the target object image storage unit <com:B>21</com:B> (step A<com:B>6</com:B>: Yes), the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> terminates learning. If there is a target object image stored in the target object image storage unit <com:B>21</com:B> (step A<com:B>6</com:B>: No), the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> performs the processing in step A<com:B>1</com:B> again.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0092" com:pNumber="0091">Note that, in step A<com:B>1</com:B>, the generation unit <com:B>2</com:B> generates an addition image while increasing the size of the portion that overlaps a target object image, of a setting image, as updating progresses. In step A<com:B>2</com:B>, the action recognition and estimation unit <com:B>3</com:B> updates the updating parameters based on the results of action recognition and setting image estimation by using these addition images.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0093" com:pNumber="0092">Specifically, addition images are generated such that the ratio between the area where the setting image overlaps the target object image and the area of the target object image is small. Thereafter, the ratio is gradually increased while the processing in steps A<com:B>1</com:B> to A<com:B>6</com:B> is iterated. For example, in the first iteration, an addition image is generated with the ratio being set to 10%, and in the tenth iteration, the ratio is set to 20%. In the 100<com:Sup>th </com:Sup>iteration, the ratio is set to 40%.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0094" com:pNumber="0093">In this way, in the initial stage, an additional image in which the overlap between the target object image and the setting image is minimized is used, and the area of the overlap in the additional image to be used is gradually increased. Thus, it is possible to establish an accurate learning model. When the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> performs learning, if an addition image from which setting images cannot be easily estimated is used in the initial stage, learning accuracy regarding action recognition decreases. Therefore, it is preferable that an addition image from which setting images cannot be easily estimated is used in the initial stage.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0095" com:pNumber="0094">If the estimation loss is large, the learning parameters are updated without using an addition image with a large estimation loss. Specifically, learning is performed again after excluding addition images with a large estimation loss. Also, in step A<com:B>4</com:B>, if the estimation loss calculation unit <com:B>5</com:B> determines that the loss is large, the estimation loss calculation unit <com:B>5</com:B> instructs the learning parameter updating unit <com:B>6</com:B> not to update the parameters in the holding unit <com:B>27</com:B>.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0096" com:pNumber="0095">This is because, when the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> performs learning, if an addition image from which setting images cannot be easily estimated is used, learning accuracy regarding action recognition decreases. Therefore, it is preferable that an addition image from which setting images cannot be easily estimated is used. This is particularly effective when applied to the initial stage.</com:P>

         <com:P com:id="p-0097" com:pNumber="0096">As described above, according to the present example embodiment, various target object images and setting images are prepared, a large number of addition images in different patterns are prepared, and the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> can be trained using a large number of addition images. Therefore, it is possible to improve accuracy in action recognition performed by the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B>. That is to say, the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> is trained using a large number of addition images generated by utilizing a computer or the like, instead of using actually captured images as in conventional art, and therefore it is possible to improve accuracy in action recognition performed by the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B>.</com:P>
         <com:P com:id="p-0098" com:pNumber="0097">Also, in the present example embodiment, when the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> is to be trained, the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> is trained regarding recognition of actions of a target object by using a large number of addition images generated in advance, and is also trained regarding estimation of setting images. That is to say, when the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> is to be trained, the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> performs learning regarding action recognition and learning regarding estimation of setting images at the same time. Furthermore, formulization is performed so that learning can be performed with a focus on action recognition rather than estimation of setting images. As a result, it is possible to establish an action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> that can perform accurate action recognition to recognize actions of a target object, after the setting images are removed from the addition images. In other words, the action recognition apparatus <com:B>1</com:B> can perform learning so as to improve accuracy in action recognition in its entirety even though estimation of setting images is inaccurate.</com:P>
